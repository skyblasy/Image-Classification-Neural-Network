# Cat vs Dog Image Classification

## Project Description
This is an image classification project, classifying images of dogs and cats in various contexts, environmenst, and poses. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of advanced image processing techniques using data augmentation, transfer learning, along with using a neural network to train the model providing highly accurate results across multiple metrics including accuracy, precision and mae. The model made use of four hidden dense layers with the “swish” activation function, which I found greatly improved performance.
